My solution(s) for Advent Of Code

## Little prologue

I wrote all my solutions in Python (and a little bit of CoffeeScript :D), with the pursuit of object orientation. Not all puzzles are done, but I'll try to finish them. When I made multiple versions of a single solution, I numbered the filenames (eg.: if there is a `main.py` and a `main2.py`, then `main2.py` is the later version).

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.0+, and its built-in modules
- CoffeeScript, and LiveScript compilers
- C++ compiler
- Coding skills

## Search through files

I wrote the solutions in a plenty of different languages, and I wanted to make sure that I could (and you could) find them all, so I made a search utility.

I made the search tool in Python, and you can run it with:

```bash
python search.py
```

Then type in the year, day, part, and select the programming language.
